.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B dnrd\fR is a proxying nameserver. It forwards DNS queries to the appropriate
nameserver, but can also act as the primary nameserver for a subnet
behind a firewall.  Proxying is configured on the command line using
the
.B \-s
option.  By default, dnrd will act as the primary nameserver for hosts
found in
.I /etc/hosts\fR.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-a
.TP 
.B \-\-address
Bind only to the interface with the specified address. By default
.B dnrd\fR binds to everything.

.TP 
.B \-b
.TP 
.B \-\-load\-balance
Turn on load balancing. All forward servers that are specified after
this option (with
.B \-s\fR) will load balance in a round robin scheme. By default,
.B dnrd\fR will use the next server in the list if the first times out. As soon
as the first is reactivated, it will be used again. With
.B \-b
option, dnrd will use next active server as soon a request is
served. If a server times out it will be deactivated and will not be
used until it comes back. As soon it is reactivated it will join the
list.
.sp
Note that if there are no
.B \-s
after the
.B \-b\fR, this will do nothing at all.

.TP 
.BR \-c \ ( \fIoff |[ \fIlow: ] \fIhigh )
.TP 
.BR \-\-cache= ( \fIoff |[ \fIlow: ] \fIhigh )
This option can be used to either turn
.I off\fR caching of DNS responses, or to change the
.I high \fRand \fIlow\fR watermarks. With the
.I high\fR/\fIlow
water mark option, cached entries are purged when the number of
responses reaches the
.I high\fR\-water
mark, and they will be purged until the number of cached responses
reaches the
.I low\fR\-water
mark, purging the oldest first. By default, caching is on, with
.I low
and
.I high
water\-marks of 800 and 1000 respectively.

.TP 
.B \-d \fILEVEL
.TP 
.B \-\-debug=\fILEVEL
This turns on debugging level
.I LEVEL\fR.
The
.B dnrd 
process will not fork into the background and print out debugging
information in the current console. Supported debug levels are 1-4
The higher level, the more debug info is printed.
.sp
The
.B \-l
option can be used to force dnrd to run in the background and log
debug info to syslog.
.sp
Sending signal SIGUSR1 will toggle the debug level between level
0 (no debugging) and level 3.

.TP 
.B \-h
.TP 
.B \-\-help
Prints usage information

.TP 
.B \-i
.TP 
.B \-\-ignore
Ignore cache for deactivated servers. If a forward DNS server times
out and gets deactivated, all cache entries for this server are
ignored. This helps avoid network timeout delays when
.B dnrd
serves a offline/dialup network.

.TP 
.B \-k
.TP 
.B \-\-kill
Kills the currently running
.B dnrd
process.

.TP 
.B \-l
.TP 
.B \-\-log
Send all messages to syslog.
.B dnrd
uses the deamon facility. If used with the
.B \-d
flag, this option will cause
.B dnrd
to fork and run in the background, logging all debugging messages to
syslog.


.TP 
.BR \-m \ ( \fIoff | \fIhosts )
.TP 
.BR \-\-master= ( \fIoff | \fIhosts )
.B dnrd
can act as the primary name server for a number of hosts. By default,
it will read in
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/master
to determine how this is done.  If that file
doesn't exist, it will act as the primary server for the hosts found in
.I /etc/hosts\fR.
This option allows you to override the default behavior. Setting it to
.I off
turns off all primary server functionality. Setting it to
.I hosts
causes
.B dnrd
to act as the primary server for hosts in
.I /etc/hosts
regardless of whether it could find
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/master\fR.
.sp
Sending the signal HUP to the
.B dnrd
process will cause the
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/master
file to be re\-read. Since
.I /etc/hosts
is outside the chrooted envronment,
.B dnrd
will not be able to reread this file. Therefore it is not recommended
to use
.I /etc/hosts
at all. Future versions of
.B dnrd
will not support any use of
.I /etc/hosts\fR.

.TP 
.BI \-M\  N
.TP 
.BI \-\-max\-sock= N
Set the maximum allowed open sockets. Default is \fI200\fR.

.TP 
.BI \-r\  N
.TP 
.BI \-\-retry= N
Set the retry interval time. When a forward DNS server times out it is
deactivated. (use the
.B \-t
option to set the timeout value)
.B dnrd
will try to send a request for localhost every
.I N
seconds. As soon there are a respose from a deactivated server, it is
reactivated. The default value is
.I 10
seconds. Setting this to zero will make
.B dnrd
to never deactivate a server.

.TP 
.BI \-s\  ipaddr \fR( :domain \fR)
.TP 
.BI \-\-server= ipaddr \fR( :domain \fR)
Add a forward DNS server. If multiple
.B \-s
options are given,
.B dnrd
treats the first as a primary DNS server and the rest as backup
servers. If the primary DNS server times out, it is deactivated and
the next specified server (that is active) is used until the previous
gets reactivated.
.sp
The
.I domain
option allows dnrd to determine which DNS server should get the query
based on the domain name in the query. This is useful when you have an
internet connection and a vpn connection to work, for
instance. Several servers with the same
.I domain
might be specified and then will they work as backup servers.
.sp
If
.B \-b
option is specified, then will all servers specified after the
.B \-b
option, be grouped by
.I domain\fR,
and load balanced.

.TP 
.BI \-t\  N
.TP 
.BI \-\-timeout= N
Set the timeout value for forward DNS servers. If a server don't
respond to a query within
.I N
seconds it is deactivated. The default value is
.I 20
.
.sp
Setting this to zero will make
.B dnrd
to never deactivate a server because of timeouts. However, a server
might be deactivated if sendto fails.

.TP 
.BI \-u\  userid
.TP 
.BI \-\-userid= userid
By default,
.B dnrd
switches to uid
.I 65535
after starting up. This is a security feature.  The default uid can be
overridden using this option.
.I userid
can either be a name or a number.

.TP 
.B \-v
.TP 
.B \-\-version
Prints out the version number.

.SH "BUGS"
.PP 
Sending \-SIGHUP will not reread the
.I /etc/hosts
file since
.B dnrd
is chrooted to
.I @DNRD_ROOT@\fR.
Use
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/master
instead and avoid using
.I /etc/hosts
at all.

.SH "FILES"
.PP 
.B @DNRD_ROOT@/master
.PP 
This file is used to configure
.B dnrd
as a primary nameserver.
.PP 
.B /etc/hosts
.PP 
By default,
.B dnrd
will act as a primary nameserver for hosts found in this file. Note
that this file will not be used at all in future versions.
.PP 
.B /var/run/dnrd.pid
.PP 
The currently\-running
.B dnrd
process' pid is placed into this file. It is needed to allow new dnrd
processes to find and kill the currently running process.
