  * Local Cache
  
    dnrd does now local caching if not turned off with the `--cache=off'
    command line switch.  This is done by storing complete DNS server
    responses in a local cache area which expires from time to time.
  
    Normal responses are held for at least 60 minutes but not longer than
    6 hours. Negative responses (nslooku tells `Non existent host/domain')
    are stored for only five minutes.  These settings are defined in
    cache.h

    The cache knows also a high- and a lowwater mark.  If after an expire
    the number of stored items is above the highwater mark (default 1000),
    cache items are removed until the lowwater mark (default 750) is
    reached.  The values can be set with `--cache=[<low>:]high' on the
    command line.
