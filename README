The Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD) is a simple "proxy" nameserver.
It is meant to be used for home networks that can connect to the internet
using one of several ISP's.

DNRD is pretty simple.  It takes DNS queries from hosts, and forwards them
to the "real" DNS server.  It takes DNS replies from the DNS server, and
forwards them to the client.  What makes DNRD special is that it can be
configured to forward to different DNS servers depending on what ISP you
are dialing.

Before DNRD, there was no easy way to change the default nameserver on a Linux
system.  You can play games with /etc/resolv.conf, such as copying other
versions of this file in place depending on which ISP you're dialing into,
but that is a pain.  Instead, you can run DNRD on your dial-up machine.
Whenever you dial into an ISP, run dnrd with the appropriate DNS server
as an argument.  Here's an example of how you would run it:

    dnrd  -s 1.2.3.4

DNRD was originally designed to work in conjuction with mserver.  It works
very well with mserver, but works just fine with other dialup systems as well
as in other non-dialup environments.

Please read the INSTALL file for information on how to build & run dnrd.
