  * Local DNS Master

    dnrd can work as a DNS master server, using the contents of the
    @DNRD_ROOT@/master file.  This is useful for small LAN, where
    only a few hosts need name resolution.   The master server function
    can be turned off with the `--master=off' command line switch.
    The master file may contain the following directives:
    
    	domain <domain> [<dns> ...] [+auth]

		sets the default domain for the following records to
		<domain>.  If <domain> is followed by additional names
		a NS record is stored for each <dns>. If the optional
		+auth keyword is found dnrd will reply with
		authoritative responses for any lookup under <domain>.
		(This can include an authoritative Host Not Found.)

    	<ipunmber> <name> [...]

		creates A and PTR records for each <name>.  If <name>
		does not contain a `.' the current default domain is
		appended.  For names that have a `.' but should have
		the default domain appended the last character must
		be a `+'.


	hosts <filename> [<domain>]

		create records (type A and PTR) from the contents of
		the file <filename>.  <filename> must have the same
		format as /etc/hosts.
		
      Domain Authority
      dnrd will automatically take the domain authority for the
      in-addr.arpa domains with at least one defined host.

      For example, if you define

		192.168.1.1	dns.quietsche-entchen.de

      dnrd will answer as if it is authorative for PTR lookups in the
      domain 1.168.192.in-addr.arpa (reverse lookups).  This keeps
      clients with more than one name server in /etc/resolv.conf from
      asking other servers if dnrd can't resolve the request.

      Localhost
      Furthermore dnrd always adds forward and reverse mapping for
      the localhost with the IP number 127.0.0.1, so

		nslookup - 127.0.0.1

      will always work on the dnrd server machine.
