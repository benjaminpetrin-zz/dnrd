.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B dnrd\fR is a proxying nameserver. It forwards DNS queries to the appropriate
nameserver, but can also act as the primary nameserver for a subnet
behind a firewall.  Proxying is configured on the command line using
the
.B \-s
option.  By default, dnrd will act as the primary nameserver for hosts
found in
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/master\fR
and queries to hostnames listed in
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/blacklist \fR
will be answered with a "host not found".

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-a
.TP 
.B \-\-address
Bind only to the interface with the specified address. By default
.B dnrd\fR binds to everything.

.TP 
.B \-b
.TP 
.B \-\-load\-balance
Turn on load balancing. All forward servers (specified with
.B \-s\fR) after this option will load balance in a round robin scheme. By default,
.B dnrd\fR will use the next server in the list if the first times out. As soon
as the first is reactivated, it will be used again. With
.B \-b
option, dnrd will use next active server as soon a request is
served. If a server times out it will be deactivated and will not be
used until it comes back. As soon it is reactivated it will join the
list.
.sp
Note that if there are no servers specified with
.B \-s
after the
.B \-b\fR, this will do nothing at all.

.TP
.B \-B \fIBLACKLIST
.TP
.B \-\-blacklist=\fIBLACKLIST
Blacklist all hostnames listed in the file BLACKLIST. Queries to hosts listed
in this file will be answered with "host not found". The file BLACKLIST is
specified relative to the DNRD chroot directory (defaults to @DNRD_ROOT@). By 
default dnrd will look for a file named "blacklist".

.TP 
.BR \-c \ ( \fIoff |[ \fIlow: ] \fIhigh )
.TP 
.BR \-\-cache= ( \fIoff |[ \fIlow: ] \fIhigh )
This option can be used to either turn
.I off\fR caching of DNS responses, or to change the
.I high \fRand \fIlow\fR watermarks. With the
.I high\fR/\fIlow
water mark option, cached entries are purged when the number of
responses reaches the
.I high\fR\-water
mark, and they will be purged until the number of cached responses
reaches the
.I low\fR\-water
mark, purging the oldest first. By default, caching is on, with
.I low
and
.I high
water\-marks of 800 and 1000 respectively.

.TP 
.B \-d \fILEVEL
.TP 
.B \-\-debug=\fILEVEL
This turns on debugging level
.I LEVEL\fR.
Supported debug levels are 0-4, where 0 mean no debugging and 4 maximum
verbosity.
.sp
Sending signal SIGUSR1 will toggle the debug level between level
0 (no debugging) and level 3.

.TP
.B \-f
.TP 
.B \-\-foreground
Run process in foreground rather than fork to background. Messages will
be sent to stderr rather than syslog.

.TP 
.B \-h
.TP 
.B \-\-help
Prints usage information

.TP 
.B \-i
.TP 
.B \-\-ignore
Ignore cache for deactivated servers. If a forward DNS server times
out and gets deactivated, all cache entries for this server are
ignored. This helps avoid network timeout delays when
.B dnrd
serves a offline/dialup network.

.TP 
.B \-k
.TP 
.B \-\-kill
Kills the currently running
.B dnrd
process.

.TP 
.BR \-m \ ( \fIoff | \fIFILE )
.TP 
.BR \-\-master= ( \fIoff | \fIFILE )
.B dnrd
can act as the primary name server for a number of hosts. By default,
it will read in
.I @DNRD_ROOT@/master
to determine how this is done.
This option specifies another file than @DNRD_ROOT@/master or turns off 
all primary server functionality.
Sending 
.B dnrd
signal -HUP will make dnrd try to re-read the master file unless this is
option is set to "off". Therefore, the master file have to be within the
dnrd-root. the file is specified relative to dnrd-root.


.TP 
.BI \-M\  N
.TP 
.BI \-\-max\-sock= N
Set the maximum allowed open sockets. Default is \fI200\fR.


.TP 
.BI \-r\  N
.TP 
.BI \-\-retry= N
Set the retry interval time. When a forward DNS server times out it is
deactivated. (use the
.B \-t
option to set the timeout value)
.B dnrd
will try to send a request for localhost every
.I N
seconds. As soon there are a respose from a deactivated server, it is
reactivated. The default value is
.I 10
seconds. Setting this to zero will make
.B dnrd
to never deactivate a server.


.TP
.B \-R \fIDIR
.TP
.B \-\-dnrd\-root=\fIDIR
Set the dnrd-root to
.I DIR\fR.
.B dnrd
will chroot to this directory at startup so all files, masterfile and
blacklist, must be here. This option overrides the environment variable 
DNRD_ROOT. Default dnrd-root is 
.I @DNRD_ROOT@\fR.


.TP 
.BI \-s\  ipaddr \fR( :domain \fR)
.TP 
.BI \-\-server= ipaddr \fR( :domain \fR)
Add a forward DNS server. If
.B \-s
is used multiple times, the first is the primary DNS server and the rest are
backup servers.  If the primary DNS server times out, it is deactivated and
the next specified server (that is active) is used until the previous
gets reactivated.
.sp
The
.I domain
option allows dnrd to determine which DNS server should get the query
based on the domain name in the query. This is useful when you have an
internet connection and a vpn connection to work, for
instance. Several servers with the same
.I domain
might be specified and then will they work as backup servers.
.sp
If the
.B \-b
option is specified, then all servers specified after the
.B \-b
option are load balanced per
.I domain\fR.


.TP
.BI \-S\  N\fR[\fI+\fR]
.TP
.BI \-\-stats= N\fR[\fI+\fR]
Print statistics about cache hits, cache misses and timeouts to syslog every
.I N
seconds.
If 
.I +
is specified, the counters will not be reset after the print.

.TP 
.BI \-t\  N
.TP 
.BI \-\-timeout= N
Set the timeout value for forward DNS servers. If a server don't
respond to a query within
.I N
seconds it is deactivated. The default value is
.I 12
.
.sp
Setting this to zero will make
.B dnrd
to never deactivate a server because of timeouts. However, a server
might be deactivated if sendto fails.


.TP 
.BI \-u\  userid
.TP 
.BI \-\-userid= userid
Set the UID that
.B dnrd
will run as. By default,
.B dnrd
tries to switches to uid
.I dnrd
after starting up.


.TP 
.B \-v
.TP 
.B \-\-version
Prints out the version number.
